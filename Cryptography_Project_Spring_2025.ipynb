    "# Digraphs in Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "In cryptography, a **digraph** is a pair of consecutive letters treated as a single unit during the encoding and decoding processes. This approach can enhance security by encoding pairs of letters together, making it more challenging to perform frequency analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Use Digraphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using digraphs instead of single letters makes cryptographic attacks, like frequency analysis, more difficult. This is because the patterns in pairs of letters (digraphs) are more complex and less predictable than those of individual letters.\n",
